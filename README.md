- Pass data layer by layer and activate neurons and generate output which is then used to calculate loss and this the used to calculate gradient and update the parameters.

**Explain the concept of a neuron in Deep Learning.**
- Input is multiplied by weight and then add bais
- Apply a activation function which is responsible for for non linearity

**What is an activation function in a Neural Network?**
- Activation functions determine the output of | neurons and introduce non-linearity into neural networks.

# ML
- **Decision Tree**
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**





# Linear Regression
   
   - $X$: The matrix of input features (with dimensions $1000 \times p$, where $1000$ is the number of observations and $9$ is the number of predictors and first column containing 1 only).
   - $Y$: The vector of observed outcomes (with dimensions $1000 \times 1$).
   - $\beta$: The vector of estimated coefficients (with dimensions $10 \times 1$).
   - $\hat{Y}$: The vector of predicted values (with dimensions $1000 \times 1$).

**Predicting Values ($\hat{Y}$)**:
 $\hat{Y} = X\beta$

**1. Closed Form Formula / The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**

 $\beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T Y$

**2. Non-Closed Form Formula**
Run these for n epoches

$\frac{dL}{d\beta} = -2X^T Y + 2X^T X \beta$ 

$\beta_{n} = \beta_{n-1} - \frac{\alpha}{1000} \frac{dL}{d\beta}$ .

## Polynomial Regression

Suppose we have three features and we want apply degree 2 polynonial features then calculate or make ney features -> $x^2 , y^2, z^2, xy, xz, yz$. Now apply normal linear regression.














# Logistic regression

![](https://i.ibb.co/StJbWBw/Untitled.png)

### 1. Percepton Trick
- If a point is in wrong region then move line towards the line
- Do not work bcoz it stops once a boundry is created thus not give best result

![](https://i.ibb.co/ByYr0pL/Untitled.png)

for n in range(1000): 
- $W_n = W_{n-1} + \eta(Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)x_i^T$
- $\hat{Y_i} = x_i W_{n-1}$

**$W_n$**: The updated weight vector after the $n$ th iteration of dimension 10×1.

**$W_{n-1}$**: The weight vector from the previous $(n-1)$ th iteration.

**$\eta$**: The learning rate.

**$x_i$**: The feature vector corresponding to the $i$ th data point of dimension 1×10.

### 2. Sigmoid function

$\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$

for n in range(1000): 
- $W_n = W_{n-1} + \eta(Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)x_i^T$
- $\hat{Y_i} = \sigma(x_i W_{n-1})$
  
### 3. Maximum Likelihood
$\text{Loss} = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( y_i \cdot \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \cdot \log(1 - \hat{y}_i) \right)$

For epoch in range(10):
- $W = W_{n-1} + \frac{\eta}{m} X^T (Y - \hat{Y})$
- $\hat{Y} = X W_{n-1}$

## Softmax Regression / Multinomial Logistic Regression
**1. Method-One**
- Apply one hot encoding

 ![](https://i.ibb.co/bW3qrVm/Untitled-1.png)
- Train model for each column

**2. Method-Two**

$\text{Loss} = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{k} \left( y^{(i)}_k \cdot \log(\hat{y}^{(i)}_k) \right)$


## Imp Points
- We can apply L1, L2, elatic net regression








# KNN
It based on the concept "You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with"

### Steps Involved:
1. Normalize the Data
2. Find the Distance of All Points:    
     - Use Euclidean distance:  
       $d(x, y) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2}$
3. Identify the K Nearest Neighbors
4. Determine the Output:
   - KNN for Classification:
     - **Majority Vote**: The label of the query point is determined by the majority class among the K nearest neighbors.
   - KNN for Regression:
     - **Average (or Weighted Average)**: The predicted value for the query point is the average (or a weighted average) of the values of the K nearest neighbors.





# SVM (Support Vector Machine)
![](https://i.postimg.cc/N0YydtDp/Untitled.png)

- The aim of this is to maximise the distance between $π_+$ and $π_-$ and minimise the distance distance of wrong output pints to there repective correct margin plane.

$\arg\min_{w*, b*} \left( Margin Error + Classification Error\right)$

$\arg\min_{w*, b*} \left( \frac{1}{2} ||w||^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^n \zeta_i \right)$

### where:
- **$w$** : Weight vector.
- **$b$** : Bias term.
- **$C $** : Regularization parameter.
- **$\frac{1}{2} ||w||^2 $** : Regularization term that penalizes large weights.
- **$\sum_{i=1}^n \zeta_i $** : Sum of the slack variables $𝜁_𝑖$​, which represent the amount by which each data point deviates from the correct classification margin.

This objective function seeks to minimize a combination of the margin (through the regularization term) and the misclassification error (through the slack variables). The goal is to find the optimal $w*$ and $b*$ that achieve this balance.

**We use Kernels for non linear seperable data**















# Ensemble Learning
Based on the concept of the wisdom of the crowd, decisions made by multiple models have a higher chance of being correct. Ensemble learning helps convert a low-bias, high-variance model into a low-bias, low-variance model because the random/outliers are distributed among various models instead of going to a single model.

#### Voting Ensemble
In this approach, different models of various types, such as SVM, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, calculate results. For classification tasks, the output with the highest frequency is selected as the final result, or we add probabilities of each class obtained from models. For regression tasks, the mean of the outputs is calculated.

#### Stacking
In stacking, different models of various types, such as SVM, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, are used to calculate results. The outputs of these models are then used to train a final model, such as KNN, to obtain the final output. This final model effectively assigns a weight to each previous model's prediction.

#### Bagging
In bagging, multiple models of the same type (i.e., using the same algorithm) are trained. Each model is trained on a different sample of the data, not the entire dataset. The final result is determined by averaging (for regression) or using majority voting (for classification).

#### Boosting
In boosting, different models are connected in series. The error made by one model is passed on to the next model in the series, which attempts to correct it. This process continues, with each subsequent model focusing on the errors of the previous one.

## Bagging Techniques
- **Row Sampling with Replacement:** Standard bagging technique where data is sampled with replacement.
- **Pasting:** Row sampling without replacement.
- **Random Subspaces:** Column sampling, which can be done with or without replacement.
- **Random Patches:** Both row and column sampling are performed, with or without replacement.

  **Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error:** Approximately 37% of samples are not used for model training, so this data can be used for testing the model.

## Decision tree vs. Bagging

## Voting
We are given 3 models, each having an accuracy of 0.7.

                                        1
                                      /   \
                                    /       \
                                  /           \
                                /               \
                              /                   \
                            0.7                   0.3
                            / \                   / \
                          /     \               /     \
                        /        \             /       \
                       0.7       0.3        0.7         0.3
                      / \        / \        / \         / \
                   0.7   0.7   0.7  0.3   0.7  0.3    0.7  0.3
                    ✔    ✔     ✔         ✔            


Final Accuracy:

$0.7 \times 0.7 \times 0.7 + 0.7 \times 0.7 \times 0.3 + 0.7 \times 0.3 \times 0.7 + 0.3 \times 0.7 \times 0.7 = 0.784$

### Types:
- **Hard Voting:** The output with the highest frequency is selected as the final result, i.e., argmax().
- **Soft Voting:** We add probabilities of each class obtained from models and then select the class with the highest value.

## Stacking
![](https://i.ibb.co/kh92jNk/Untitled.png)

#### 1. Hold Out Method (Blending)
- Split the training data into two parts.
- Train base models on the first part.
- Use the second part to generate predictions using stacked models, which are used as input for the meta-model.
- The meta-model is trained on these predictions.

#### 2. K-Fold Approach (Stacking)
- Split the training data into K folds.
- Train K models of the same type, each leaving out one fold for predictions.
- Predictions from the out-of-fold data are used to train the meta-model.
- The meta-model is trained on the stacked predictions.
- Finally, the base models are retrained on the entire dataset.

# K-Means
### Choosing the Right Number of Clusters
#### 1. Elbow Method / The Within Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)
For each cluster, calculate the squared distance of other points in the same cluster to the centroid and sum them. Calculate for each cluster.

Calculate the number of clusters for which increasing the number of clusters does not decrease WCSS.

![](https://imgs.search.brave.com/S375W7i4sbazwDDMbtKJfNz2efEl71MpaiLmVgjR470/rs:fit:500:0:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5z/dGFja2FidXNlLmNv/bS9tZWRpYS9hcnRp/Y2xlcy9rLW1lYW5z/LWNsdXN0ZXJpbmct/d2l0aC10aGUtZWxi/b3ctbWV0aG9kLTEu/cG5n)

#### 2. The Average Silhouette Score
The silhouette coefficient $S(i)$ for a particular data point $i$ is a measure of how similar $i$ is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. The formula for calculating the silhouette coefficient is as follows:

$S(i) = \frac{b(i) - a(i)}{\max{a(i), b(i)}}$

Where:
- $S(i)$ is the silhouette coefficient for data point $i$.
- $a(i)$ is the average distance between $i$ and all the other data points in the same cluster as $i$ .
- $b(i)$ is the smallest average distance from $i$ to all clusters to which $i$ does not belong. In other words, it's the distance to the nearest cluster that $i$ is not a part of.

The silhouette coefficient $S(i)$ ranges between -1 and 1:
- $S(i)$ close to 1 indicates that the data point is well-clustered.
- $S(i)$ close to 0 indicates that the data point is on or very close to the decision boundary between two neighboring clusters.
- $S(i)$ close to -1 indicates that the data point might have been assigned to the wrong cluster.

Find the average $S_{\text{avg}}$ :

$S_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Sigma S(i)}{n}$

Choose the cluster where $S_{\text{avg}}$ is maximum.

![](https://i.sstatic.net/iAWnF.png)

#### 3. The Calinski Harabasz Score

$\text{CH} = \frac{\text{Tr}(B_k)}{\text{Tr}(W_k)} \times \frac{n - k}{k - 1}$

Where:
- $\text{CH}$ is the Calinski-Harabasz Score.
- $\text{Tr}(B_k)$ is the trace of the **between-cluster dispersion matrix**.
- $\text{Tr}(W_k)$ is the trace of the **within-cluster dispersion matrix**.
- $n$ is the **total number of data points**.
- $k$ is the **number of clusters**.

#### **Between-Cluster Dispersion Matrix ($B_k$)**
This measures the dispersion **between different clusters**. It is defined as:

$B_k = \sum_{j=1}^{k} n_j (\mu_j - \mu)(\mu_j - \mu)^T$

Where:
- $n_j$ is the number of data points in cluster $j$ .
- $\mu_j$ is the centroid of cluster $j$ .
- $\mu$ is the overall mean of the data.

#### **Within-Cluster Dispersion Matrix ($W_k$)**
This measures the dispersion **within each cluster**. It is defined as:


$W_k = \sum_{j=1}^{k} \sum_{x_i \in C_j} (x_i - \mu_j)(x_i - \mu_j)^T$

Where:
- $x_i$ are the data points in cluster $C_j$ .
- $\mu_j$ is the centroid of cluster $j$ .


**Higher Score**: Indicates that clusters are well-separated and compact.

**Lower Score**: Suggests overlapping or poorly defined clusters.
