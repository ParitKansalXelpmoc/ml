# Linear Regression
   
   - $X$: The matrix of input features (with dimensions $1000 \times p$, where $1000$ is the number of observations and $9$ is the number of predictors and first column containing 1 only).
   - $Y$: The vector of observed outcomes (with dimensions $1000 \times 1$).
   - $\beta$: The vector of estimated coefficients (with dimensions $10 \times 1$).
   - $\hat{Y}$: The vector of predicted values (with dimensions $1000 \times 1$).

**Predicting Values ($\hat{Y}$)**:
 $\hat{Y} = X\beta$

**1. Closed Form Formula / The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**

 $\beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T Y$

**2. Non-Closed Form Formula**
Run these for n epoches

$\frac{dL}{d\beta} = -2X^T Y + 2X^T X \beta$ 

$\beta_{n} = \beta_{n-1} - \frac{\alpha}{1000} \frac{dL}{d\beta}$ .

# Logistic regression

![](https://i.ibb.co/StJbWBw/Untitled.png)

### 1. Percepton Trick
- If a point is in wrong region then move line towards the line
- Do not work bcoz it stops once a boundry is created thus not give best result

![](https://i.ibb.co/ByYr0pL/Untitled.png)

for n in range(1000): 
- $W_n = W_{n-1} + \eta(Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)x_i^T$
- $\hat{Y_i} = x_i W_{n-1}$

**$W_n$**: The updated weight vector after the $n$ th iteration of dimension 10×1.

**$W_{n-1}$**: The weight vector from the previous $(n-1)$ th iteration.

**$\eta$**: The learning rate.

**$x_i$**: The feature vector corresponding to the $i$ th data point of dimension 1×10.

### 2. Sigmoid function

$\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$

for n in range(1000): 
- $W_n = W_{n-1} + \eta(Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)x_i^T$
- $\hat{Y_i} = \sigma(x_i W_{n-1})$
  
### 3. Maximum Likelihood
$\text{Loss} = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( y_i \cdot \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \cdot \log(1 - \hat{y}_i) \right)$

For epoch in range(10):
- $W = W_{n-1} + \frac{\eta}{m} X^T (Y - \hat{Y})$
- $\hat{Y} = X W_{n-1}$

## Softmax Regression / Multinomial Logistic Regression
**1. Method-One**
- Apply one hot encoding

 ![](https://i.ibb.co/bW3qrVm/Untitled-1.png)
- Train model for each column

**2. Method-Two**

$\text{Loss} = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{k} \left( y^{(i)}_k \cdot \log(\hat{y}^{(i)}_k) \right)$


## Imp Points

# KNN
It based on the concept "You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with"

### Steps Involved:
1. Normalize the Data
2. Find the Distance of All Points:    
     - Use Euclidean distance:  
       $d(x, y) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2}$
3. Identify the K Nearest Neighbors
4. Determine the Output:
   - KNN for Classification:
     - **Majority Vote**: The label of the query point is determined by the majority class among the K nearest neighbors.
   - KNN for Regression:
     - **Average (or Weighted Average)**: The predicted value for the query point is the average (or a weighted average) of the values of the K nearest neighbors.

# Naive Bayes Classifier

$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A ∩ B)}{P(B)}$

$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$

$P\left(\frac{Won}{A∩B∩C}\right) = \frac{P\left(\frac{A∩B∩C}{Won}\right) \cdot P(Won)}{P(A∩B∩C)}$

$P\left(\frac{A∩B∩C}{Won}\right) = P\left(\frac{A,B,C}{Won}\right) = P\left(\frac{A}{Won}\right) \cdot P\left(\frac{B}{Won}\right) \cdot P\left(\frac{C}{Won}\right)$

$P\left(\frac{A∩B∩C}{Won}\right) = \frac{P\left(\frac{A}{Won}\right) \cdot P\left(\frac{B}{Won}\right) \cdot P\left(\frac{C}{Won}\right) \cdot P(Won)}{P(A∩B∩C)}$

$P\left(\frac{Won}{A∩B∩C}\right) ∝ {P\left(\frac{A}{Won}\right) \cdot P\left(\frac{B}{Won}\right) \cdot P\left(\frac{C}{Won}\right) \cdot P(Won)}$

$P\left(\frac{Loss}{A∩B∩C}\right) ∝ {P\left(\frac{A}{Loss}\right) \cdot P\left(\frac{B}{Loss}\right) \cdot P\left(\frac{C}{Loss}\right) \cdot P(Loss)}$


### Example
| Toss  | Venue    | Outlook   | Result |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Won   | Mumbai   | Overcast  | Won    |
| Lost  | Chennai  | Sunny     | Won    |
| Won   | Kolkata  | Sunny     | Won    |
| Won   | Chennai  | Sunny     | Won    |
| Lost  | Mumbai   | Sunny     | Lost   |
| Won   | Mumbai   | Sunny     | Lost   |
| Lost  | Chennai  | Overcast  | Lost   |
| Won   | Kolkata  | Overcast  | Lost   |
| Won   | Mumbai   | Sunny     | Won    |

$P\left( \frac{Won}{Lost, Mumbai, Sunny} \right) ∝ {P\left(\frac{Lost}{Won}\right) \cdot P\left(\frac{Mumbai}{Won}\right) \cdot P\left(\frac{Sunny}{Won}\right) \cdot P(Won)} = 
\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{9}$

### Handling Numerical values

For numerical features, the Naive Bayes classifier uses the Gaussian (normal) distribution:

$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$


You would apply this formula to compute the probability density for numerical values in each class, such as "Won" or "Loss."

This approach allows the Naive Bayes classifier to handle both categorical and numerical data.

# SVM (Support Vector Machine)
![](https://i.postimg.cc/N0YydtDp/Untitled.png)

- The aim of this is to maximise the distance between $π_+$ and $π_-$ and minimise the distance distance of wrong output pints to there repective correct margin plane.

$\arg\min_{w*, b*} \left( Margin Error + Classification Error\right)$

$\arg\min_{w*, b*} \left( \frac{1}{2} ||w||^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^n \zeta_i \right)$

### where:
- **$w$** : Weight vector.
- **$b$** : Bias term.
- **$C $** : Regularization parameter.
- **$\frac{1}{2} ||w||^2 $** : Regularization term that penalizes large weights.
- **$\sum_{i=1}^n \zeta_i $** : Sum of the slack variables $𝜁_𝑖$​, which represent the amount by which each data point deviates from the correct classification margin.

This objective function seeks to minimize a combination of the margin (through the regularization term) and the misclassification error (through the slack variables). The goal is to find the optimal $w*$ and $b*$ that achieve this balance.

**We use Kernels for non linear seperable data**

# CART - Classification and Regression Trees

**Pseudo code**
1. Begin with your training dataset, which should have some feature variables and classification or regression output.
2. Determine the “best feature” in the dataset to split the data on; more on how we define “best feature” later
3. Split the data into subsets that contain the correct values for this best feature. This splitting basically defines a node on the tree i.e each node is a splitting point based on a certain feature from our data.
4. Recursively generate new tree nodes by using the subset of data created from step 3.

**Advantages** 
- Intuitive and easy to understand
- Minimal data preparation is required
- The cost of using the tree for inference is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree

**Disadvantages** 
- Overfitting
- Prone to errors for imbalanced datasets

## Decision Tree

### Entropy

$\text{E}(x) = -\sum_{i=1}^{c} p_i\log_2(p_i)$

where $p_i$ is simply the frequentist probability of an element class $i$ in our data.

[![Untitled.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Dw93QRQP/Untitled.png)](https://postimg.cc/PCQ7T3RC)

**Observation**
- For a 2 class problem the min entropy is O and the max is 1
- For more than 2 classes the min entropy is O but the max can be greater than 1
- Both $log_2$ or $log_e$ can be used to calculate entropy i

### Gini impurity

$G = 1 - \sum P_i^2$

**Some times Gini Impurity may give balanced tree incomparision to entropy**

[![Untitled1-1.png](https://i.postimg.cc/YSwTLMRQ/Untitled1-1.png)](https://postimg.cc/18JvLxLz)


### Information Gain 

$\text{Information Gain} = \text{E}(Parent) - \frac{1}{\text{Total Weight}}\sum Weight_i*\text{E}(child_i)$

$\text{Information Gain} = \text{G}(Parent) - \frac{1}{\text{Total Weight}}\sum Weight_i*\text{G}(child_i)$

### ALGORITHM
- Entropy / Gini impurity of Parent
- Calculate Entropy / Gini impurity for Children
- Calculate weighted Entropy / Gini impurity of Children
- Calculate Information Gain for all the columns
- Whichever column has the highest Information Gain(maximum decrease in entropy) the algorithm will select that column to split the data.
- Once a leaf node is reached ( Entropy = 0 ), no more splitting is done.

### Calculate Information Gain for Numerical data column
- Sort the data on the basis of numerical column
- Split the entire data on the basis of every value of numerical column
- Calculate Information Gain for each split
- Select Max Information Gain and it is the Information Gain for that column

[![Untitled.png](https://i.postimg.cc/k5Zp9H7H/Untitled.png)](https://postimg.cc/WDGnwXFm)


## Regression Trees
### ALGORITHM
- Calculate Standard Deviation of the Parent Node
- Calculate Standard Deviation for Child Nodes
   - For Categorical Features: Split the data into different groups based on the unique labels of the categorical feature. Compute the standard deviation of the target variable for each group (child node).
   - For Numerical Features: Perform repeated splits for each unique value of the numerical feature. For each possible split, divide the data into two groups (child nodes) and calculate the standard deviation of the target variable within each group.
- Calculate Weighted Standard Deviation of Children
- Calculate Information Gain:
   - Information Gain = Std of Parent − Weighted Std of Children
- Calculate Information Gain for all the columns
- Whichever column has the highest Information Gain the algorithm will select that column to split the data.
- The algorithm recursively repeats the process for each child node until a stopping criterion is met.
- At each leaf node, the output is the mean of the target variable values within that node..

## Feature importance for decision tree like algos
Calculate this for each node t and which has split for feature $i$

$Feature Importance(i) = \sum_{t \in \text{nodes where feature } i \text{ is used}} \frac{N_t}{N} \left( impurity - \frac{N_{t_r}}{N_t} \cdot RightImpurity - \frac{N_{t_l}}{N_t} \cdot LeftImpurity \right)$

- $Feature Importance(i)$:  Importance score for feature $i$.
- $N_t$: Number of samples at node $t$.
- $N$: Total number of samples.
- $\text{impurity}$: Impurity measure at node $t$ (e.g., Gini impurity, entropy).
- $N_{t_r}$: Number of samples in the right child node after the split.
- $N_{t_l}$: Number of samples in the left child node after the split.
- $\text{Right Impurity}$: Impurity of the right child node of node t.
- $\text{Left Impurity}$: Impurity of the left child node of node t.

# Ensemble Learning
Based on the concept of the wisdom of the crowd, decisions made by multiple models have a higher chance of being correct. Ensemble learning helps convert a low-bias, high-variance model into a low-bias, low-variance model because the random/outliers are distributed among various models instead of going to a single model.

#### Voting Ensemble
In this approach, different models of various types, such as SVM, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, calculate results. For classification tasks, the output with the highest frequency is selected as the final result, or we add probabilities of each class obtained from models. For regression tasks, the mean of the outputs is calculated.

#### Stacking
In stacking, different models of various types, such as SVM, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, are used to calculate results. The outputs of these models are then used to train a final model, such as KNN, to obtain the final output. This final model effectively assigns a weight to each previous model's prediction.

#### Bagging
In bagging, multiple models of the same type (i.e., using the same algorithm) are trained. Each model is trained on a different sample of the data, not the entire dataset. The final result is determined by averaging (for regression) or using majority voting (for classification).

#### Boosting
In boosting, different models are connected in series. The error made by one model is passed on to the next model in the series, which attempts to correct it. This process continues, with each subsequent model focusing on the errors of the previous one.

## Bagging Techniques
- **Row Sampling with Replacement:** Standard bagging technique where data is sampled with replacement.
- **Pasting:** Row sampling without replacement.
- **Random Subspaces:** Column sampling, which can be done with or without replacement.
- **Random Patches:** Both row and column sampling are performed, with or without replacement.

  **Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error:** Approximately 37% of samples are not used for model training, so this data can be used for testing the model.

## Decision tree vs. Bagging
| **Bagging** | **Decision Tree** |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Features are selected before training the decision tree, i.e., feature sampling is done at the tree level. | Some features are selected randomly at each node, and Information Gain (or Gini Index) is calculated for these feature to decide the best split. |
| It introduces less randomness into the model as the same set of features is used across the entire tree. | It introduces more randomness as the features are selected at each node, which can lead to different splits and trees. |

## Voting
We are given 3 models, each having an accuracy of 0.7.

                                        1
                                      /   \
                                    /       \
                                  /           \
                                /               \
                              /                   \
                            0.7                   0.3
                            / \                   / \
                          /     \               /     \
                        /        \             /       \
                       0.7       0.3        0.7         0.3
                      / \        / \        / \         / \
                   0.7   0.7   0.7  0.3   0.7  0.3    0.7  0.3
                    ✔    ✔     ✔         ✔            


Final Accuracy:

$0.7 \times 0.7 \times 0.7 + 0.7 \times 0.7 \times 0.3 + 0.7 \times 0.3 \times 0.7 + 0.3 \times 0.7 \times 0.7 = 0.784$

### Types:
- **Hard Voting:** The output with the highest frequency is selected as the final result, i.e., argmax().
- **Soft Voting:** We add probabilities of each class obtained from models and then select the class with the highest value.

## Stacking
![](https://i.ibb.co/kh92jNk/Untitled.png)

#### 1. Hold Out Method (Blending)
- Split the training data into two parts.
- Train base models on the first part.
- Use the second part to generate predictions using stacked models, which are used as input for the meta-model.
- The meta-model is trained on these predictions.

#### 2. K-Fold Approach (Stacking)
- Split the training data into K folds.
- Train K models of the same type, each leaving out one fold for predictions.
- Predictions from the out-of-fold data are used to train the meta-model.
- The meta-model is trained on the stacked predictions.
- Finally, the base models are retrained on the entire dataset.

# K-Means
### Choosing the Right Number of Clusters
#### 1. Elbow Method / The Within Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)
For each cluster, calculate the squared distance of other points in the same cluster to the centroid and sum them. Calculate for each cluster.

Calculate the number of clusters for which increasing the number of clusters does not decrease WCSS.

![](https://imgs.search.brave.com/S375W7i4sbazwDDMbtKJfNz2efEl71MpaiLmVgjR470/rs:fit:500:0:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5z/dGFja2FidXNlLmNv/bS9tZWRpYS9hcnRp/Y2xlcy9rLW1lYW5z/LWNsdXN0ZXJpbmct/d2l0aC10aGUtZWxi/b3ctbWV0aG9kLTEu/cG5n)

#### 2. The Average Silhouette Score
The silhouette coefficient $S(i)$ for a particular data point $i$ is a measure of how similar $i$ is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. The formula for calculating the silhouette coefficient is as follows:

$S(i) = \frac{b(i) - a(i)}{\max{a(i), b(i)}}$

Where:
- $S(i)$ is the silhouette coefficient for data point $i$.
- $a(i)$ is the average distance between $i$ and all the other data points in the same cluster as $i$ .
- $b(i)$ is the smallest average distance from $i$ to all clusters to which $i$ does not belong. In other words, it's the distance to the nearest cluster that $i$ is not a part of.

The silhouette coefficient $S(i)$ ranges between -1 and 1:
- $S(i)$ close to 1 indicates that the data point is well-clustered.
- $S(i)$ close to 0 indicates that the data point is on or very close to the decision boundary between two neighboring clusters.
- $S(i)$ close to -1 indicates that the data point might have been assigned to the wrong cluster.

Find the average $S_{\text{avg}}$ :

$S_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Sigma S(i)}{n}$

Choose the cluster where $S_{\text{avg}}$ is maximum.

![](https://i.sstatic.net/iAWnF.png)

#### 3. The Calinski Harabasz Score

$\text{CH} = \frac{\text{Tr}(B_k)}{\text{Tr}(W_k)} \times \frac{n - k}{k - 1}$

Where:
- $\text{CH}$ is the Calinski-Harabasz Score.
- $\text{Tr}(B_k)$ is the trace of the **between-cluster dispersion matrix**.
- $\text{Tr}(W_k)$ is the trace of the **within-cluster dispersion matrix**.
- $n$ is the **total number of data points**.
- $k$ is the **number of clusters**.

#### **Between-Cluster Dispersion Matrix ($B_k$)**
This measures the dispersion **between different clusters**. It is defined as:

$B_k = \sum_{j=1}^{k} n_j (\mu_j - \mu)(\mu_j - \mu)^T$

Where:
- $n_j$ is the number of data points in cluster $j$ .
- $\mu_j$ is the centroid of cluster $j$ .
- $\mu$ is the overall mean of the data.

#### **Within-Cluster Dispersion Matrix ($W_k$)**
This measures the dispersion **within each cluster**. It is defined as:


$W_k = \sum_{j=1}^{k} \sum_{x_i \in C_j} (x_i - \mu_j)(x_i - \mu_j)^T$

Where:
- $x_i$ are the data points in cluster $C_j$ .
- $\mu_j$ is the centroid of cluster $j$ .


**Higher Score**: Indicates that clusters are well-separated and compact.

**Lower Score**: Suggests overlapping or poorly defined clusters.

# Ada Boosting

1. **Initial Weights**: For a dataset with $n$ samples, initialize the weight for each row/sample as $\frac{1}{n}$.
   - $w_i = \frac{1}{n}, \quad \text{for all } i \text{ where } i \text{ is the row number}$

   |x|y|$w_i$|
   |-|-|-----|
   | | |$\frac{1}{n}$|

2. **Train a Weak Learner**: Train a decision tree of depth 1 (also known as a decision stump) using the current weights.
3. **Predictions**: Use the trained decision stump to make predictions on the training data.

   |x|y|$w_i$        |$\hat{y}$|
   |-|-|-------------|---------|
   | | |$\frac{1}{n}$|         |

4. **Error Calculation**: Calculate the error $\epsilon$ of the stump, which is the sum of the weights of the misclassified samples:
   - $\epsilon = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i \cdot I(\text{pred}_i \neq \text{actual}_i)$. Here, $I$ is the indicator function that returns 1 if the prediction is incorrect and 0 if correct.

   |x|y|$w_i$        |$\hat{y}$|$\epsilon$|
   |-|-|-------------|---------|----------|
   | | |$\frac{1}{n}$|         |          |


5. **Performance of Stump $\alpha$**: Calculate the performance of the stump (also called the weight of the weak learner):
   - $\alpha = \frac{1}{2} \log \left(\frac{1 - \epsilon}{\epsilon}\right)$
  

6. **Update Weights**: Update the weights of the samples based on their prediction outcome:
   - If the prediction is correct: $w_i^{\text{new}} = w_i \cdot e^{-\alpha}$
   - If the prediction is incorrect: $w_i^{\text{new}} = w_i \cdot e^{\alpha}$

   |x|y|$w_i$        |$\hat{y}$|$\epsilon$|$w_i^{\text{new}}$|
   |-|-|-------------|---------|----------|------------------|
   | | |$\frac{1}{n}$|         |          |                  |

7. **Normalize Weights**: Normalize the updated weights so that they sum to 1: $w_i^{\text{new normal}} = \frac{w_i^{\text{new}}}{\sum_{j=1}^n w_j^{\text{new}}}$

   |x|y|$w_i$        |$\hat{y}$|$\epsilon$|$w_i^{\text{new}}$|$w_i^{\text{new normal}}$|
   |-|-|-------------|---------|----------|------------------|-------------------------|
   | | |$\frac{1}{n}$|         |          |                  |                         |

8. **Make Bins**: Create bins corresponding to the normalized weights. The bins are cumulative sums of the weights, which will be used to sample the data points for the next iteration.

   |x|y|$w_i$        |$\hat{y}$|$\epsilon$|$w_i^{\text{new}}$|$w_i^{\text{new normal}}$|$bins$|
   |-|-|-------------|---------|----------|------------------|-------------------------|------|
   | | |$\frac{1}{n}$|         |          |                  |                         |      |

9. **Generate Random Numbers**: Generate random numbers between 0 and 1. Each random number corresponds to a bin, and the row whose bin it falls into is selected for training the next weak learner.
10. This process is repeated for a specified number of iterations or until a desired accuracy is achieved and for iteration 1 to set 9 are folloewd and make sure to use to use $w_i$ not $w_i^{\text{new}}$.
11. The final model is a weighted sum of all the weak learners. $H(x) = \text{sign} \left( \sum_{t=1}^{T} \alpha_t \cdot h_t(x) \right)$
